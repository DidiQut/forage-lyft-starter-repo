# The new tire wear sensors produce an array of four numbers between
# 0 and 1 inclusive, representing how worn each of the tires are.
# This array will be passed to each function in the car factory class,
# to be used by your tire implementation. Carrigan tires should be serviced
# only when one or more of the values in the tire wear array is greater
# than or equal to 0.9. Octoprime tires should be serviced only when
# the sum of all values in the tire wear array is greater than or equal to 3.
# Think carefully about the cleanest way to implement the new tire
# service criteria, then modify the system to complete the change.
# When youâ€™re finished, push your changes and submit a link to your repo.
